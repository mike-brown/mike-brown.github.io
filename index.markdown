# Who am I?

I am a passionate problem solver with a desire to support others in growing and achieving their potential. I enjoy working closely with product teams to produce short-term tactical solutions to immediate issues, or help to define longer-term solutions to support their strategic vision.

With 15 years of software engineering experience, working in the both the health research and online gambling industries, I have strived to always have a positive impact for end users, internal users, and my collegues.
